## Introduction

### Background

Mount Rainier, standing as the highest peak in the Cascade Range, is a challenging climb attracting adventurers from around the world. Weather conditions play a crucial role in the safety and success of a climb. Adverse weather, including storms, low visibility, and extreme temperatures, can pose significant risks to climbers. This project seeks to uncover patterns in historical weather data and understand how these conditions impact a climber's ability to reach the summit.

### Data Source

The primary data source for this analysis is historical weather data collected on Mount Rainier. This dataset includes information on temperature, wind speed, precipitation, visibility, and other relevant weather metrics. Additionally, summit success and failure records will be integrated, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis. Data has been sourced from kaggle.com 

### Data Sources:
The primary data source for this analysis is historical weather data collected on Mount Rainier. This dataset includes information on temperature, wind speed, precipitation, visibility, and other relevant weather metrics. Additionally, summit success and failure records will be integrated, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### Key Components:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Investigate the historical weather data to identify patterns and trends.
   - Analyze the correlation between weather variables and climbers' success rates.

2. **Predictive Model:**
   - Develop a machine learning model to predict a climber's chance of summiting based on current and forecasted weather conditions.
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Create visualizations to communicate key insights, such as the impact of temperature, wind, and visibility on summit success.
   - Generate interactive charts and graphs for a user-friendly exploration of the data.

### Significance:
Understanding the relationship between weather conditions and climbers' success on Mount Rainier can provide valuable insights for expedition planning, risk management, and safety protocols. The predictive model aims to offer a tool for climbers and guides to assess the feasibility of a summit attempt based on real-time weather forecasts.

### Expected Outcomes:
- Identification of critical weather variables influencing summit success.
- A reliable predictive model for climbers to assess summit probability.
- Enhanced safety measures and decision-making for Mount Rainier expeditions.

This project strives to contribute valuable information to the mountaineering community, aiding climbers in making informed decisions and ensuring a safer and more successful climbing experience on Mount Rainier.
