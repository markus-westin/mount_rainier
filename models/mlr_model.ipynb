    "# Multiple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will develop a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to predict the chance of summitting based on the inputted weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLR Model is based upon the following assumptions:\n",
    "* *Linearity:* There is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables\n",
    "* *Homoskedasticity:* The residuals have constant variance at every point in the linear model\n",
    "* *Independence of Errors:* Errors are independent\n",
    "* *Multivariate Normality:* Errors should be normally distributed\n",
    "* *No Multicollinearity:* None of the independent variables are highly correlated with each other "
